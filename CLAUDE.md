# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

catallenya is a self-hosted infrastructure project replacing third-party cloud services with open-source alternatives. It runs on a ZFS-backed storage pool (`/zpool/catallenya`) and is orchestrated entirely through Docker Compose.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Start a specific service
docker compose up -d <service-name>

# Rebuild archivebox (only service with a custom Dockerfile)
docker compose up -d --build archivebox

# View logs
docker compose logs -f <service-name>

# Run the security audit
bash audit/audit.sh

# Check backup snapshots
bash restic/restic.snapshots.sh

# Restore from backup
bash restic/restic.restore.sh
```

## Architecture

### Network Topology

Traffic flows through two paths:
- **Tailscale (internal)**: All services are accessed via `${TAILNET_DOMAIN}.${TAILNET_DNS_NAME}:<port>` through Caddy reverse proxy with auto-TLS from Tailscale
- **Cloudflare Tunnel (external)**: Internet-facing services (blog, memos, archive, zipline) route through `cloudflared` to `*.catallenya.com`

Caddy reads the Tailscale socket directly (`tailscaled.sock`) for certificate management. The Tailscale container must use `hostname: catallenya` because generated certificates are tied to this name.

### Port Assignments (via .env)

| Variable                         | Service     |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `NTFY_REVERSE_PROXY_PORT`        | Ntfy        |
| `FLAME_REVERSE_PROXY_PORT`       | Flame       |
| `GHOST_REVERSE_PROXY_CADDY_PORT` | Ghost       |
| `RADICALE_REVERSE_PROXY_PORT`    | Radicale    |
| `SYNCTHING_REVERSE_PROXY_PORT`   | Syncthing   |
| `IMMICH_REVERSE_PROXY_PORT`      | Immich      |
| `ARCHIVEBOX_REVERSE_PROXY_PORT`  | Archivebox  |
| `MEMOKA_REVERSE_PROXY_PORT`      | Memoka      |

### Service Dependencies

- **Immich** depends on `redis` (Valkey) and `postgres` (custom pgvector image)
- **Memoka** depends on its own `memoka_postgresql` (pgvector/pg17) and `memoka_redis`
- **Zipline** depends on `zipline_postgresql`
- **Archivebox** uses `archivebox_sonic` for search; scheduler depends on both
- **Caddy** depends on `tailscale` for TLS certificate socket

### Secrets Management

Docker secrets are used for sensitive values (stored as gitignored files under their respective service directories). Additional credentials (DB passwords, service secrets) are in `.env`, which is also gitignored.

### Backup System

Restic backs up to cloud storage via Rclone (configured in `restic/restic.conf`). Managed by systemd timers:
- `restic.backup.timer` - scheduled backups
- `restic.check-meta.timer` / `restic.check-data.timer` - integrity checks
- `restic.forget.timer` - prune old snapshots (retention: 5 daily, 2 weekly, 3 monthly, 1 yearly)

ZFS snapshots are managed by Sanoid separately.

### Monitoring

- **Disk monitoring**: `systemd/disk.timer` runs every 15 min, alerts via Ntfy at 75% usage
- **Service monitoring**: `ntfy/system-ntfy.sh` reports restic job status to Ntfy
- **Watchtower**: Auto-updates containers with `com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true` label, polls hourly

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) runs on push to main:
- **Trivy**: Filesystem vulnerability scan (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM)
- **GitLeaks**: Scans git history for leaked secrets

## Key Conventions

- All persistent data lives under `/zpool/catallenya/<service>/data`
- Services run as `user: "1000:1000"` where possible for filesystem permission consistency
- Security-sensitive containers (radicale) use `read_only: true`, `cap_drop: ALL`, memory limits, and `no-new-privileges`
- Watchtower handles image updates for registry-pulled images; archivebox requires manual rebuild since it uses a local Dockerfile
- The Caddyfile uses env var substitution (`{$VAR}`) for all domains and ports -- never hardcode these values
