# Every test suite in the repo, defined ONCE, run by the ci/pre-push hook.
#
# HOOK-ONLY, AND THAT IS NOT A CHOICE — it is a measurement. Unlike ci/contract.sh
# and ci/shellcheck.sh beside it, this cannot be a CI job: every suite here resolves
# /zpool/catallenya absolutely and deliberately (systemd/heartbeat.sh sources the
# transport by absolute path with a comment saying why; ntfy/system-ntfy.sh reads the
# root .env the same way). Run in a container with no /zpool on 2026-08-23, six of
# the seven fail in bulk and the seventh cannot start. Making them portable means
# changing how production scripts find themselves to satisfy a runner, which is a
# real risk taken for a second-order gain. So they run here, on the machine where
# their assumptions are true.
#
# THE COST IS REAL AND WAS CHOSEN WITH THE NUMBER IN FRONT OF US. Measured on this
# box: 131s for all seven, against 1.7s for the contract gate and 5.9s for the shell
# check. A push therefore takes a little over two minutes.
#
# (That line is worded around a trap: a comment whose first word after `#` is
# "shellcheck" is parsed as a DIRECTIVE, and shellcheck then fails the file with
# SC1073 rather than reading it as prose.)
#
# That runs against ci/pre-push's own warning — "a check that fires on every docs
# typo is a check people learn to skip with --no-verify, which would cost the secret
# guard its credibility too, since that is the same flag." The warning still stands
# and is the thing to watch. If two minutes on a docs commit starts producing
# --no-verify, the fix is to SCOPE this to the suites whose directories changed
# (measured: ~8s for a docs push), not to delete it. Do that before reaching for the
# flag even once.

# FASTEST FIRST, so a failure surfaces as early as it can. Measured 2026-08-23:
#   ntfy 0.2s · host 0.9s · liquidroom 2.6s · afterimage 3.2s
#   ai 8.4s · pigeonhole 43.3s · systemd 72.3s
# The last two are 88% of the wall clock for 31% of the tests.
#
# HARDCODED, NOT GLOBBED, for the reason host/smart.sh hardcodes its device list: a
# glob that matches fewer suites than yesterday runs fewer tests and still exits 0 —
# a checker whose failure reads as success, which is the shape this repo hunts. A
# new suite is a deliberate line here. The guard below is what stops that becoming a
# way to forget one.
