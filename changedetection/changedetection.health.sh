#
# changedetection CANNOT self-report a broken watch. Verified empirically 2026-08-02
# with unmuted throwaway watches rechecked past the 6-failure threshold: a DNS failure,
# an HTTP 404, a re-gated endpoint and a filter that stops matching ALL leave
# notification_alert_count at 0. Every error branch in worker.py just writes last_error
# onto the watch and returns; only FilterNotFoundInResponse notifies, and that is raised
# solely by `if not filtered_content.strip()` — which a jq filter building an array can
# never satisfy, because it returns the two-character string "[]". So a dead watch is
# indistinguishable from a quiet one unless something outside asks. This is that thing.
#
# Publishes to the SAME topic changedetection itself uses. Deliberate: a new topic is one
# more thing to subscribe to on the phone, and a monitoring alert nobody is subscribed to
# is worse than no alert at all (ntfy creates topics on first publish and returns 200).

# Here the notification IS the work, so the transport's silence is the test: curl
# -fsS prints nothing on a successful publish and prints the failure otherwise, and
