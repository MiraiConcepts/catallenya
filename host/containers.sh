# Container fleet monitor — the roll call the 26 containers never had.
#
# The 20 systemd jobs have catallenya.heartbeat. The containers had nothing, and
# `restart: unless-stopped` is what makes that dangerous rather than merely missing:
# a container that crashes on startup oscillates forever without ever being "failed",
# so docker reports it as running-ish, systemd never hears about it, and the only
# thing that notices is a human opening the app and finding it dead.
#
# Nineteen containers publish a healthcheck that, until this job existed, NOTHING
# consumed. Seven publish none at all — and ntfy is one of the seven, which is the
# case that matters most: when ntfy dies every other alert in this fleet is dropped
# with no trace, so the alert channel was the single least observed thing on the box.
#
# Silent when healthy, like disk.sh, smart.sh and restic.staleness. Publishes to the
# `host` topic — the same channel boot events and the watchdog roll call use, because
# this is the same question asked about a different population, and an unsubscribed
# monitoring topic swallows alerts with a 200 OK.

#
# Per RUN rather than per CONTAINER, which is where this differs from smart.sh: that
# job watches three fixed devices whose faults are independent, while a fleet failure
# is usually correlated (docker restarts, the box reboots, a compose edit lands) and
# arrives as one event with N symptoms. One message listing them is what you want to
# read at a glance; twenty-six that replace each other individually is not.
#
# It does NOT self-clear when the fleet recovers. A fault has no buttons, and a
# notification without buttons is never withdrawn by the system — an absent message is
# ambiguous, a stale one is not. See ntfy/MESSAGES.md § 4.
