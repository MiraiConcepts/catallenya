# The off-box dead-man's switch.
#
# THIS IS THE ONE ALARM THAT DOES NOT LIVE ON THIS BOX. Everything else here —
# the heartbeat, the five gauges, the courier — dies with the machine, and a box
# that is dark reports nothing about being dark. The only shape that escapes that
# is inverted: something OUTSIDE is told to expect a signal on a schedule, and
# raises the alarm when the signal STOPS. Silence becomes the alert.
#
# WHY IT PINGS CONDITIONALLY, which is the whole design.
#
# An unconditional ping only ever proves the box has power. The gap actually worth
# closing is narrower and worse: ntfy is a container ON this box, so when it dies
# every alert in the fleet is dropped with no trace — a failing backup, a dying
# disk, a stopped watchdog all publish into nothing and every layer built to notice
# reports healthy. Nothing on this box can report that, because reporting it needs
# the thing that is broken.
#
# So the condition is exactly that question: CAN OUR ALERTS STILL GET OUT?
#
#   ntfy reachable      -> ping. healthchecks.io stays quiet, and any real problem
#                          reaches the phone through the normal channel.
#   ntfy unreachable    -> DO NOT PING. Three hours later healthchecks.io says the
#                          box has gone quiet, which is true in the only sense that
#                          matters: nothing this box says can reach you.
#
# THE WATCHING IS MUTUAL, and that is the answer to "who watches healthchecks.io".
# They watch us by our silence; we watch them by the ping's failure — a ping that
# does not return 2xx is reported through our own ntfy, which by then we have just
# proven works. Their own FAQ says multi-day outages are possible (one-person ops
# team), so this direction is not theoretical. Neither side is trusted to be up.
#
# Silent when healthy, like every other monitor here.

#
# The heartbeat is the one job nothing else checks, and CLAUDE.md claimed for a
# day that THIS script covered it. It did not: until 2026-08-24 the only mention
# of the heartbeat here was a comment. The gap is real and specific — if
# catallenya.heartbeat.timer stops, ntfy stays healthy, so this job keeps pinging,
# healthchecks.io stays green, and every "did that job actually run" finding simply
# stops being computed. Six of those jobs are silent when healthy, so a stopped
# restic, a stopped sanoid, a stopped disk gauge and a stopped SMART job all become
# indistinguishable from working ones. Nothing would ever say so.
#
# This is the right script for it precisely because it is a DIFFERENT unit on a
# DIFFERENT schedule: the heartbeat cannot be the thing that notices it has died.
#
# It NOTIFIES and still PINGS, deliberately. Refusing to ping would conflate two
# unrelated faults — this job's contract is "ping only while alerts can get out",
# and a stale heartbeat is not an alert-channel failure. ntfy has just been proven
# working three lines above, so the box can report this itself; spending the
# external alarm on it would make silence mean two things at once.
