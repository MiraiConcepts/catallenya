# SMARTCTL seam, so it can join without changing that script.
#
# EVERY CASE HERE IS A BRANCH THAT DECIDES WHETHER AN ALERT HAPPENS. A monitor that
# silently reports "all clear" is worse than no monitor, so the cases that assert

# on it would make silence mean two different things — the exact ambiguity the
