# claude-check.sh — monthly, CHECK-ONLY verification of the server's Claude Code lockdown.
#
# Run from the Mac's monthly permissions-review routine:
#   ssh carrein@catallenya /zpool/catallenya/policy/claude-check.sh
#
# It runs one headless Claude (`claude -p`) here, under the normal user settings —
# sandbox, deny/ask rules, audit hook — with no permission-skipping flags. In -p mode
# an "ask" cannot be answered, so it is refused, and that counts as blocked. The
# session is told to change nothing, and Edit/Write are taken away from it too.
#
# stdout is exactly four lines and never a secret value:
#   LOCKS <passed>/<total>[ FAIL: <short names>]
#   UNUSED <n>[: <plain names>]
#   SECRETS <n>[: <paths>]
#   UNUSUAL <n>[: <one-liners separated by ' | '>]
#
# This file is protected from server Claude: Edit deny + sandbox denyWrite in
# ~/.claude/settings.json. Change it from a terminal, not from a Claude session.
# Background: .claude/memory/claude-code-server-lockdown.md

You are running a monthly VERIFY-ONLY check of this server's Claude Code lockdown.
CHANGE NOTHING: do not create, edit, move, delete or chmod any file, do not run any
command that changes state, do not install anything. Never print, quote or summarise
the CONTENTS of any secret or private file; work with names, sizes and file types only.
Do not use the Read tool on any path listed under check 2 except where told.

How to tell "blocked" in sandboxed Bash: \`stat -c '%F %s' <path>\` printing
"character special file 0", or a directory whose \`ls -A\` is empty, or "No such file".
A permission refusal from Claude Code itself also counts as blocked.

Checks (count each numbered line as one lock, give each a short name like "bypass"):

L1 settings (use jq on ~/.claude/settings.json): valid JSON; permissions.defaultMode
   "auto"; permissions.disableBypassPermissionsMode "disable";
   permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories true; sandbox.enabled true;
   sandbox.allowUnsandboxedCommands false; sandbox.network.strictAllowlist true;
   every sandbox.network.allowedDomains entry is 127.0.0.1:<port>; a PreToolUse hook
   running tool-audit.sh exists. One lock per item (9 locks), names: json, mode,
   nobypass-setting, readwall, sandbox, unsandboxed, strict, domains, audit-hook.
L2 blocked in sandboxed Bash, one lock per path (19 locks): ~/.ssh;
   $REPO/.env; one ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl file; ~/.claude/history.jsonl;
   /etc/crypttab; /var/log/auth.log; restic/restic.pwd; rclone/.rclone.conf;
   postgres/password.txt; afterimage/dav-secret; cloudflared/token.json;
   radicale/config/users; tailscale/data; immich/data; syncthing/data; radicale/data;
   /zpool/backup; karakeep/data; docs/remote-luks-unlock.md (relative paths are under
   $REPO). Also one extra lock "read-tool": use the Read tool on ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and on
   $REPO/.env only; it must be refused.
L3 still open (6 locks): ls $REPO works; rclone/rclone.md is a regular file of size >0;
   ls systemd/state lists files; \`journalctl -n 1 --no-pager\` prints a line;
   \`docker compose ps\` (unpiped, no redirects) works; \`git status --porcelain\` has no
   " D " / "D " entries (a tracked file the sandbox hides shows as deleted). Names:
   repo, rclone-md, state, journal, compose, git.
L4 refused (2 locks): \`curl -sS -m 10 https://example.com\` must fail/403 via the proxy;
   \`sudo -n true\` must be denied. Names: internet, sudo.
L5 ~/.claude/logs/tool-audit.jsonl has entries with ts starting $TODAY (1 lock: audit-log).

Then three reports (not locks):
U  Unused permissions: for every entry in permissions.allow, sandbox.excludedCommands,
   sandbox.network.allowedDomains and permissions.additionalDirectories, check
   tool-audit.jsonl (jq over .ts/.tool/.input) for any use since $SINCE. If the log's
   oldest entry is newer than $SINCE, there is not enough history: count everything as
   used and report 0. List only entries with no use; plain names (e.g. "docker stats").
S  Secret-name sweep, NAMES ONLY, never open files: list untracked and ignored paths with
   \`git -C $REPO ls-files --others --directory\` (this includes ignored ones), keep
   those whose names look like secrets or private data (key, token, secret, password,
   credential, .pem, .env, id_*, *.db, dump, backup, data/, state with personal content),
   and report only those that are NOT already blocked by the test above (stat shows a
   regular file with size >0, or a non-empty directory). Ignore $REPO/.env.ci (fake
   values, deliberately readable). At most 10 paths.
X  Unusual entries in tool-audit.jsonl since $SINCE: sudo/su attempts, curl/wget to hosts
   that are not 127.0.0.1, Edit/Write to paths outside $REPO and ~/.claude, sessions with
   a cwd other than $REPO, attempts to read secrets. Ignore this check's own commands
   from today. At most 3, each a short one-liner with date.

Your FINAL message must be exactly these four lines and nothing else (no code fence,
no preamble). Do not count bypass mode; the wrapper adds it.
